# Policy-Gradient-Simple
Implementation of vanilla policy gradient for the pole balancing problem using TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym. This was written back in May 2018. 
The program trains a policy gradient agent on the pole balancing problem and prints its scores after each episode. It then creates a graph of its performance over time. I've included an example of the graph generated from 1000 episodes of training.
